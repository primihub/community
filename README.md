## Development workflow
Below is a common contribution guide in the PrimiHub community:

We suggest using [the GitHub official CLI](https://cli.github.com/) during this process, but any git tool is ok as well.

### Step 1, Fork the target repository
Click the `Fork` button to create a fork of a project to your GitHub account. Such as click [here](https://github.com/primihub/community/fork).

### Step 2, Clone
Clone your own repository to your development environment. Normally, the repository path looks like this:

```shell
https://github.com/your-account/community
```

### Step 3, Create and Development in a new branch
Please always create a new branch when you're trying to make any changes. For example:

```shell
git checkout -b feat-xxx
```

### Step 4, Push your work
Everyone should push the changes to their own repository even if they have the commit permission of the target repository.

Please provide a readable PR title and appropriate description. You could follow the PR template if there's one.

### Step 5, Check the build status
Usually, an open-source community will take advantage of the automation workflow to do test or validation work. Please take a look at the build status, and make sure all the statuses are successful.
